Hello Josh.

This repo does not contain any of the data required by the installer. I will but this directory on no backup under the name wrf-build with all the data. As far as tasks still left to complete on this there's just expect to incorporate as discussd on Friday. I wont be playing with expect this week so if you do get it working let me know... if not I will have another go next week.
